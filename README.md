A Discord bot to recreate the use of [Steganographr](https://neatnik.net/steganographr/) within a server!

I thought it would be fun to have the ability to encode messages like this on a whim, and being able to do it from within a Discord channel definitely achieves that.

The entire interaction with the bot is handled through slash commands, and replies are sent ephemerally so there's no chance of someone else in the server being able to spot what you're doing without trying to deocde your message themselves.
